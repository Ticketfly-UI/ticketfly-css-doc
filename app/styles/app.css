/*
  Notes: 
  - Should base start at 0 or 1? ie: line-height starts at 1 but colors start at 1.
  - Sometimes we use t-shirt sizes, but other times we use number sizes. Are these descriptive enough?
  - What are border-radius intervals?
  - Some of the colors are a little off from the design spec
  - Inconsistent line spacing. Something design needs to give more specs on
  - Grid gutters come in different sizes. Show that in the demo. Confirm with design.
